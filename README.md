This is a platform agnostic Rust driver for the TMP102 and TMP112
high-accuracy, low-power, digital temperature sensors, using the
[`embedded-hal`] traits.

This driver allows you to:
- Change into one-shot or continuous conversion mode.
- Read the temperature.
- Enable/disable the extended measurement mode.
- Trigger a one-shot measurement.
- Read whether the one-shot measurement result is ready.
- Set the conversion rate.
- Set the high/low temperature threshold.
- Set the fault queue.
- Set the alert polarity.
- Set the thermostat mode.
- Read whether a comparator mode alert is active.

## The devices

This driver is compatible with both the TMP102 device as well as the TMP112
family of devices, including TMP112A, TMP112B and TMP112N.

These temperature sensors are highly linear and do not require complex
calculations or lookup tables to derive the temperature. The on-chip
12-bit ADC offers resolutions down to 0.0625°C.

The TMP102 device is a digital temperature sensor ideal for NTC/PTC
thermistor replacement where high accuracy is required. The device offers an
accuracy of +/-0.5°C without requiring calibration or external component
signal conditioning.

The TMP112 family of devices are digital temperature sensors designed for
high-accuracy, low-power, NTC/PTC thermistor replacements where high accuracy
is required. The TMP112A and TMP112B offers 0.5°C accuracy and are optimized
to provide the best PSR performance for 3.3V and 1.8V operation respectively,
while TMP112N offers 1°C accuracy.

The devices feature SMBus(TM), two-wire and I2C interface compatibility,
and allows up to four devices on one bus.

### Usage

Please find additional examples using hardware in this repository: [driver-examples]

```rust
use linux_embedded_hal::I2cdev;
use tmp1x2::{Tmp1x2, SlaveAddr};

fn main() {
    let dev = I2cdev::new("/dev/i2c-1").unwrap();
    let address = SlaveAddr::default();
    let mut sensor = Tmp1x2::new(dev, address);
    let temperature = sensor.read_temperature().unwrap();
    println!("Temperature: {:.1}ºC", temperature);
}
```

Additionally, async support can be enabled via the `async` feature. For example:  
`cargo build --features async`
